# Status Report

When your boss asks you for a status report, you may feel like shrugging it off. A progress report might seem like something minor but it can go a long way in communicating the details of a project to both your supervisor and other staff members. Providing this information can help your boss assist you with staffing, budgetary needs, support and guidance throughout the project.

*	Research the aspects of your business that you need to cover in your progress report. This includes all details of the project you're working on; you will need to know it inside and out so you can present it to your superiors. Collect reports from subordinates, peers, contractors and sub\-contractors as needed.

*	Compose your statement of purpose. This should include a brief description of the project. You don't need to be wordy as supervisors should have some information on what you're working on and they probably have limited time to read through progress reports. In this opening statement, explain why you are giving a progress report at this time.

*	Explain what work has already been completed in the body of the report. You can go into more detail here so your boss can relay this information to other parties if necessary. Outline how these tasks will help accomplish the end goal and explain what stage each task is in. Discuss how you're doing with your budget, being specific as to what items are coming in on budget and which ones aren't.

*	Consider any problems you've run into while working on this project. This could include personnel, time constraints, bottlenecks and legal matters. List these along with how you've corrected them or how you plan to correct them. If you need help with something, state it here.

*	Write about what activities are still underway. Provide a projected date of completion for them and outline any potential problems you foresee. Note in the report whether you believe the project will be finished on schedule.

*	Create a spreadsheet detailing what parts of the project are done and which ones you're still working on. Give as much detail as possible; include dates as well as actual and projected costs. Since your boss may not have a lot of time to read progress reports, providing a summary in graph form may help. This is optional but it can really be helpful if your boss is short on time or if he prefers to see things graphically instead of in words.

*	Summarize your status report. Make this section short and concise, giving just the necessary details about what you've completed and what is still left to do. Quickly review any problems or concerns you have with the project and make recommendations on how to correct them.
