![](../pic/federick-p-brooks.jpg)

*Frederick P.Brooks，Jr.* won the Turing Award in 1999 for "landmark contributions to computer architecture, operating systems, and software engineering."

He was the manager for the development of the System/360 family of computers and the OS/360 software package. He later wrote candidly about the process in his seminal book The Mythical Man-Month.
